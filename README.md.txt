🎓 Student Performance Prediction & Analysis

 Project Overview

This project analyzes student academic data and builds machine learning models to predict whether a student will pass or fail based on academic and behavioral factors.

The goal is to demonstrate data analysis, visualization, preprocessing, and basic machine learning skills.

 Objective

* Analyze student performance data
* Identify key factors affecting academic results
* Build a machine learning model to predict Pass / Fail

 Dataset

* Student academic dataset containing:

  * Gender
  * Study time
  * Absences
  * Past failures
  * Family & school support
  * Internal marks (G1, G2)
  * Final marks (G3)

* Target variable:

  * 'pass_fail'
  * '1' → Pass
  * '0' → Fail


 Tech Stack

* Python
* Google Colab
* Pandas, NumPy
* Matplotlib, Seaborn
* Scikit-learn


 Project Workflow

1. Dataset Loading
2. Data Cleaning
3. Target Variable Creation (Pass / Fail)
4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
5. Feature Selection & Encoding
6. Train–Test Split
7. Model Training
8. Model Evaluation
9. Model Comparison
10. Insights & Conclusion


 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* Study time vs performance
* Absences vs performance
* Gender vs performance
* Internal marks vs final marks

 Key Insights:

* Higher study time generally leads to better performance
* More absences increase failure chances
* Internal marks strongly influence final results
* Gender has minimal impact compared to academic factors

 Machine Learning Models Used

* Logistic Regression (Primary model)
* Decision Tree (Comparison model)

Model Comparison:

* Logistic Regression showed better and more stable accuracy
* Decision Tree was interpretable but slightly less accurate


 Results

* The Logistic Regression model achieved good accuracy in predicting student performance
* The model can help identify students at risk of failing early


 Conclusion

This project demonstrates a complete data science workflow including data analysis, preprocessing, machine learning, and model evaluation.
It is suitable for freshers and beginners and easy to explain in interviews.



 Future Improvements

* Add more features such as attendance percentage
* Try advanced models (Random Forest, XGBoost)
* Deploy as a simple web application
